  <h1>Commercial/Residential Fire Systems</h1></br>
<p>Fire systems are a necessity for homes and businesses. It takes only minutes for fires to spread to the point where lives are threatened. Fire is not the only danger: Carbon Monoxide (which is colorless, odorless and tasteless) along with other toxins can harm you as much as the actual fire. Direct Security Services offers many solutions in the fire safety area including system inspections, Carbon Monoxide detectors, and installation of a complete commercial fire system. No matter who does the work on your fire system they have to follow National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards. Here at DSS we take pride in doing our fire jobs right the first time.</p>
